   DER
        Distributed Energy Resource

        Distributed Energy Resource is a generic term that typically includes
        photo-voltaics coupled with a smart inverter, battery energy storage systems,
        electric vehicles, demand response, and other dispatchable load or generation
        available on the electric distribution network.  DER is typically owned by
        consumers or businesses, rather than utilities or wholesale energy market participants.

   FAN
    Field Area Network

   EE
    Execution Environment

   EMA
    Edge Management Agent

    The EMA is the logical component of a GEISA ADM conformant platform
    which implements ADM support.

   EMS
    Edge Management System

    Note: with the electric utility industry, EMS often means
    *Energy* Management System.  Similarly, within the network management
    system EMS often means *Element* Management System.  
    Within this specification EMS is used exclusively for Edge 
    Management System.
