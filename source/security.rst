Security
----------------

Security is fundamental to the GEISA specification,
so much so that it is included in the name itself: Grid Edge Interoperability and **Security** Allicance.

The following are the minimum criteria needed success of the GEISA specification and for the implmeentor.

- Clear expections must be illustrated
  outlining what responsibilities fall to the GEISA team
  vs the entities or individuals
  implementing the specification.
  This will be ferred to as the "Shared Responsiblity Model".
- The specification must affort an implementor the ability(ies) to
  comply with applicable standards,
  frameworks,
  certifications, etc.
  such as IEC 62433 without an undue amount of overhead
