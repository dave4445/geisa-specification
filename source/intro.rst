Introduction
------------

The GEISA Specification
describes
the operating environment
for a utility-focused
grid edge device
with sufficent detail
so that two vendors
working from the specification alone
can create an implementation
such that a GEISA compliant application
can run on both without modification.

The specification outline is as follows:

- Design Principles
- Envisioned System Architecture
- Hardware Requirements
- Operating System
- Base Libraries
- Core Services
- Application Isolation
- Application Management
- Applicaiton Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Security
