Conformance
-----------------------

The |GEISA| was established to advance interoperability within the utility industry.
Interoperability exists in many forms.   

To enable platform vendors, application developers, management system providers, 
and utilities to validate whether a given system component conforms with this
specification, |GEISA| provides an open source conformance test framework.

This framework is licensed under the `Apache License`_ and is available in the
|GEISA| `github repository`_.
