Abstract
--------

The GEISA Specification
describes
the operating environment
for a utility-focused
grid edge device
with sufficent detail
so that two vendors
working from the specification alone
can create an implementation
such that a GEISA compliant application
can run on both without modification.

While the initial focus is smart meters,
the GEISA Execution Environment (EE)
runs on a variety of devivce types.
